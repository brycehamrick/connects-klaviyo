# connects-klaviyo

This is a Connects implementation for Klaviyo. It will integrate ConvertPlug forms with Klaviyo Lists.

## Installation

Grab the zip file [here](https://github.com/brycehamrick/connects-klaviyo/archive/master.zip) and upload as a WordPress plugin.

## Usage

Use like any Connects plugin. Visit the Connects section of the ConvertPlug menu and Create a New Campaign.

Currently this plugin only supports email address and a single text field for first_name, though it could easily be extended to support more fields in the future.
